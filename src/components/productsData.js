        question : "What is the difference between Google Workspace and Google’s free apps?",
        answer: "With Google Workspace, you'll receive a number of additional business-grade services not included with Google’s free consumer apps. These services include: custom business email @yourcompany, twice the amount of cloud storage across Gmail and Drive, 24/7 phone and email support, 99.9% guaranteed uptime on business email, interoperability with Microsoft Outlook, additional security options like two-step authentication and SSO, and administrative controls for user accounts."
      },
      {
        question : "Can I purchase individual Google Workspace apps?",
        answer : "No. When you sign up for Google Workspace, you’ll gain access to a set of integrated apps that work together seamlessly. For instance, you can receive a message in Gmail and instantly convert it into a Calendar event. When you make a comment in Docs, Sheets, or Slides, collaborators automatically receive email alerts. With a single click, you can join a video meeting in Meet from your inbox or calendar. Using these tools together improves productivity and gives your business the most value. However, you are welcome to purchase the suite and only use the services of your choice."
      },
      {
        question : "Can I replace my current software with Google Workspace?",
        answer : "We’ve found that many of our customers are able to eliminate their existing productivity suites and rely exclusively on Google Workspace to create different kinds of files, including text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. You can work on those files in real time with other people and store them in the cloud with Google Drive. Google Workspace ’s apps work across devices. Unlike traditional desktop applications, there is no software to install. Google Workspace is also compatible with files made in other programs, such as Microsoft Office."
